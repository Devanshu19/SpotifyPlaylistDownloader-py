# SpotifyPlaylistDownloader-py
A simple python script to bulk download music from spotify playlists.

## How to download playlists using this thing?
* Make sure you have [python](https://python.org) installed.

* Check whether you have [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed or not. FFMPEG is required for downloading music cz it converts the music to .mp3 format.
    * If not installed, you can manually download and install it or run the .bat file which will automatically install it for you.

* (OPTIONAL) Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv .venv`.

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies. 

* Run `py main.py <link-to-the-playlist>` to start the download process.
